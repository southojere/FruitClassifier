# FruitClassifier
CNN model to predict the Strawberry, tomato, and cherry's 

Output models accuracy: 0.80

Assignment brief:
• Step 1: Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA).
• Step 2: Apply pre-processing techniques to improve quality of the data.
• Step 3: Build a simple baseline model.
• Step 4: Build a CNN model.
• Step 5: Tuning the CNN model.
  Explore:
    1. Use cross-validation on the given images to tune the model or hyper-parameters.
    2. Investigate loss functions.
    3. Investigate optimisation techniques.
    4. Investigate the regularisation strategy.
    5. Investigate the activation function.
    6. Get more data, i.e. you can obtain more data (e.g. download from internet) to enrich
    the training set.
    7. Implement ways to set hyper-parameters
    8. Use existing models pre-trained by data like ImageNet to conduct transfer learning to
    fine-tune your model.
    9. Use ensemble learning (e.g., stacking different models) to boost your model.

• Step 6: Write a report.
